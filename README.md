# Libft - Hive Helsinki
## Project Overview
**Libft** is a personal library that provides implementations of essential C standard library functions and other useful utility functions. 
This project aims to develop a deep understanding of C, memory management, and low-level system operations. It is part of the curriculum at Hive Helsinki.
##Features
This project includes implementations of several commonly used functions in C. The library provides functionalities such as string manipulation, memory operations, and file handling, designed to mimic standard library functions.

The following functions are implemented:

- **String manipulation:** ft_strlen, ft_strdup, ft_strchr, ft_strrchr, ft_strcmp, ft_strjoin, ft_substr, ft_strtrim, etc.
- **Memory operations:** ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_bzero, ft_memmove, ft_calloc, ft_memchr, ft_memcmp
- **Conversion functions:** ft_itoa, ft_atoi, ft_itoa, etc.
- **File operations:** ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, ft_putendl_fd, ft_putnbr_fd, etc.

For a full list, check the **src_1** and **src_2** directories.
